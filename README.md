## Hi there 👋
💻 I am Alexey, ML Engineer from Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

👨‍🎓 I hold a bachelor degree in Mathematics and Mechanics from Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, where I maintained an excellent academic record (GPA 4.7). Currently studying AI at ITMO University - the best Russian university in the Data Science & Artificial Intelligence category of the QS World University Rankings.

💼 My experience includes internships at Tinkoff Bank, one of the largest banks in Russia, where I developed practical skills in data science and machine learning. I enhanced data platform accessibility, created visualization materials across frameworks, and implemented an NLP-based knowledge base search system. I’m currently working on developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for code in IDE in Russian Research Institute (Huawei). I'm doing experiments to find the best way to rank code searches, as well as testing benchmarks for LLMs for generating RAG answers.

📌 I have actively participated in various tech competitions and professional courses. I was a winner at ITMO University's AI School and placed second in the "I Am a Professional" ML case competition. I’m currently learning Advanced NLP and RecSys to be engaged in more complex and diverse projects. I am also a member of the EESTEC - Electrical Engineering STudent European assoCiation, where I've led and organized several high-profile hackathons and international tech workshops.

🚀 I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to innovative projects, with a focus on leveraging AI and machine learning to solve real-world challenges. I open for joining new projects or new job. I will be very happy to collaborate with you if you develop modern projects in ML.
